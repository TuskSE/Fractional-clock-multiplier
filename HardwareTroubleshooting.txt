Trigger outs:
- cycle out LED doesn't work, but trigger outs all produce a voltage. The voltage is ~4.88V; will have to check at some point whether this is sufficient for triggering most modules. 


Trig IN triggers much too easily (even with zero input voltage). Tracked down to missing ground collection on the transistor base!

CV in works ok, although at high voltage it starts to clip. I think the offset can be moved, because there's room at the other end of the range. Maybe use a trimmer for the final circuit...
